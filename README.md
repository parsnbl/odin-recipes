# odin-recipes

A simple recipes website created as part of the Odin Project foundations course.

This project helped drill-in the basic html boilerplate conventions for muscle memory, as well as gave practice with images, lists, and links. It very adequately makes the case for a Component architecture too, as the recipe format could easily have been made one in React or Vue.
