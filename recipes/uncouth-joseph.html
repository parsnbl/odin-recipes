        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are the Jay Gatsbys of sloppy joes—suave, debonair. But we'd be remiss if we let the black-tie frippery of these cosmopolitan joes belie their true nature: Just as with Fitzgerald's famous hero, there's substance underneath all that class. These civilized sandwiches are hearty, delicious, and perfect for a weeknight dinner.</p>
        <p>Originally taken from Epicurous, but a staple at my house. Serves 4.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 1/2-ounce) can whole tomatoes in juice, drained</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 celery rib, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 kaiser rolls, split</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Purée tomatoes in a blender.</li>
            <li>Cook onion and garlic in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add carrot, celery, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add beef and brown, stirring to break up lumps, 5 to 6 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add puréed tomatoes, wine, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar and boil, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and sandwich inside rolls.</li>
        </ol>
