            <h1>Seattle Dogs</h1>
            <img src="../img/seattle-dogs.webp" alt="A plate of delicious seattle dogs.">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Seattle dogs are essentially a delicious mash-up of hot dog and bagel. The origins are often disputed, but may have something to do with a bagel cart that started selling hot dogs, too. The dogs are split open and seared and then served with cream cheese and sautéed onions or scallions.</p>
            <p>Polish sausage is often used instead of regular old dogs. Other toppings like jalapeños, sauerkraut, and cabbage can be included and condiments like mustard, Sriracha, and barbecue sauce give the dish a little tang and zip. Ketchup is typically a no-no, but we won't tell if you decide to add a drizzle.</p>
            <p>Although I live in California now, I lived in Seattle for 10+ years and miss the city greatly. This dog recipe helps me remember those times and keeps the city close to my heart. Originally taken from the Spruce Kitchen, but is pretty accurate to the hot-dog carts by Safeco field and in front of Neumos on a Saturday Night.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>4 hot dogs, or sausages</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
                <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 jalapeño, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>Sriracha sauce, for garnish</li>
                <li>Brown mustard, for garnish</li>
                <li>Sauerkraut, optional</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Split each hot dog or sausage lengthwise while keeping 2 halves together.</li>
                <li>Heat a sauté or grill pan on high heat. Add oil, onions, and salt and sauté or grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly softened and browned. Make sure to do this on high heat to get good golden color and flavor.</li>
                <li>Remove onions from pan and add hot dogs or sausages. Sear for about 2 minutes per side or until heated through and lightly browned or charred. Cover to keep warm while toasting buns.</li>
                <li>Remove hot dogs or sausages from pan and add buns. Toast split-side down. Toast until just lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add hot dogs or sausages to buns and add grilled onions to the side. Add softened cream cheese to a plastic or piping bag. Cut bottom off of bag and squeeze cream cheese over top. Then top with fresh jalapeno slices, Sriracha, and mustard. You can also add sauerkraut, if using.</li>
